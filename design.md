# Design

In the wake of the failure of the world-wide-web it is important to consider the lessons learned, 
not to simply go back to the way things were before. That is certainly not the intention here.
The web brought us not only technical marvels, but also a place to share and link
a variety of content from around the world. While simple text is ideal in a number of ways
outlined earlier and should be the default consideration, there are still many cases for other
types of media such as sound, video and complex binary formats to suit specific needs.

The web tried to make all of those different formats flow together into a single page
making the system very complex due to over generalization supporting any imagined capability
that a web site might want to use. Websites in turn used the flexibility to fund themselves
with advertising and making themselves as glossy as possible instead of focusing on the
actual content and the work flow to support it. Instead, different types of media should be
linked, not embedded allowing them to be handled specially. Systems that deal in multiple
media types should take this into consideration.

A post-web system has a level of consistency and simplicity that does not exist in the
current web. Users should expect to be able to navigate sites in much the same way as other
sites using the same tools. On the other hand uses should expect to do the same when interacting
with local services on their own computers. This helps to drastically minimize the learning
curve for the average user as their skills and techniques are more transferrable. Even if the
system requires a little more understanding of the internals consistency and simplicity allows
each learning experience to be applicable to other areas. It's time to stop treating users
as incapable of learning and instead provide them with a system that is more learnable. This
will help to lower the barrier between user and developer.
